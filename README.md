# StarkNet - Setup Guide
StarkNet is a permissionless decentralized Validity-Rollup (often referred to as ZK-Rollup). It operates as an L2 network over Ethereum, enabling any dApp to achieve unlimited scale for its computation â€“ without compromising Ethereum's composability and security.


### To run starknet we will use the nodes provided by the Alchemy service, so register at alchemy.com and create endpoints in your personal account.
